\section{Refinement via Propositional Reasoning}
\label{sec:propositional}

In this section we demonstrate that the history membership problem $h \in
\overline{H}$ reduces to propositional satisfiability, given a formula
$\textsc{Theory}(H)$ characterizing the histories of the library kernel $H$.
Note that $h \in \overline{H}$ if{f} $h$ is weaker than some history $h' \in
H$, or equivalently weaker than some history $h'$ such that $h',M \models
\textsc{Theory}(H)$, for some matching function $M$. When $h$ is complete, the
fact that any stronger history contains exactly the same set of operations
enables the construction of a formula $\textsc{Stronger}(h)$ characterizing the
histories stronger than $h$. Together with $\textsc{Theory}(H)$, this formula
describes all stronger histories satisfying $\textsc{Theory}(H)$, and is
therefore equivalent to $h \in \overline{H}$. We show how to construct these
formulas in Section~\ref{sec:propositional:complete}.

When $h$ contains pending operations, stronger histories $h'$ may contain fewer
operations, since some pending operations of $h$ may be omitted in $h'$, and
others completed. In this case the joint satisfiability of $\textsc{Theory}(H)$
and $\textsc{Stronger}(h)$ must be enhanced with additional constraints to
ensure that the operations of $h'$ include at least the completed operations of
$h$, and possibly some pending operations of $h$. We tackle this problem in
Section~\ref{sec:propositional:pending}.

\subsection{Complete Histories}
\label{sec:propositional:complete}

The following lemma characterizes the weaker than relation between
histories. It states that a history $h'$ stronger than a complete history $h$
can only differ in having more order constraints between the operations, the
operation labels being the same in $h$ and $h'$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:complete_history}

  A complete history $h=\tup{O,<,f}$ is weaker than another history
  $h'=\tup{O',<',f'}$ iff there exists a bijection $g:O' \to O$ such that:
  \begin{itemize}

    \item operations related by $g$ have the same label, i.e., for each $o\in
    O$, $f(o)=f'(g^{-1}(o))$, and

    \item order constraints are preserved from $h$ to $h'$, i.e., for each
    $o,o'\in O$, $o< o'$ implies $g^{-1}(o)<' g^{-1}(o')$.

  \end{itemize}

\end{lemma}

We characterize histories stronger than $h$ by the formula
$\textsc{Stronger}(h)$, defined as the conjunction
\begin{align*}
  \textsc{Domain}(h) \land \textsc{Labels}(h) \land \textsc{Order}(h)
\end{align*}
using the formulas of Figure~\ref{fig:formula:history} characterizing the
identifiers, labels, and order constraints of $h$. Note that the
$\textsc{Domain}(h)$ formula restricts the interpretation domain of each
variable to the operations of $h$. As a consequence of
Lemma~\ref{lemma:complete_history}, the formula $\textsc{Stronger}(h)$ does
indeed characterize all histories at least as strong as $h$.

\begin{figure}

    & \textsc{Domain}(h)
    && \bigwedge_{o_1, o_2 \in O} o_1 \neq o_2 \land \forall x.\ \bigvee_{o\in O} x = o \\

    && \hspace{-5mm} \bigwedge_{f(o) = (m(u) \Rightarrow v)}
      \hspace{-5mm}

      [{\sf ret}(o) = v]_{v \neq \bot} \\
    & \textsc{Order}(h)
    && \bigwedge_{o_1 < o_2} {\sf b}(o_1, o_2) \\
    & \textsc{Used} 
    && \forall x.\ {\sf ret}(x) \neq \bot \implies {\sf used}(x)
  \end{align*}

  \caption{Formulas characterizing histories $h = \tup{O,<,f}$ (${\sf ret}(o) = v$
  is present in $\textsc{Labels}(h)$ only if $v\neq \bot$).}
  \label{fig:formula:history}

\end{figure}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:stronger_form_complete}
  
  Let $h$ and $h'$ be histories.
  Then $h \preceq h'$ if{f} $h' \models \textsc{Stronger}(h)$.

\end{lemma}

\noindent
It follows that the library membership test $h \in \overline{H}$ for complete
histories $h$ reduces to first-order satisfiability.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{th:satisfiability_pending}

  Let $h$ be a complete history, and $H$ a history set.
  Then $h \in \overline{H}$ if{f}
  $\textsc{Stronger}(h) \land \textsc{Theory}(H)$ is satisfiable.

\end{theorem}

As long as the formula $\textsc{Theory}(H)$ contains only a fixed set of
predicates e.g.,~$=$ and $\leq$, as is the case for all formulas of
Figures~\ref{fig:formulas:common}--\ref{fig:formulas:synchronization},
satisfiability of $\textsc{Stronger}(h) \land \textsc{Theory}(H)$ reduces to
propositional satisfiability. Intuitively this holds since the domain of
(quantified) variables is restricted to operations appearing in $h$. Thus for a
given $h$ and $H$, we construct the propositional formula
$\db{\textsc{Stronger}(h) \land \textsc{Theory}(H)}$ by replacing each
universally-quantified subformula $\forall x. \varphi$ by $\bigwedge_{o \in O} \varphi[x
\mapsto o]$, and each existentially-quantified subformula $\exists x. \varphi$ by
$\bigvee_{o \in O} \varphi[x \mapsto o]$. It follows that this propositional formula is
equisatisfiable to the original first-order formula, and is constructed in
polynomial time.

\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:satisfiability_complete}

  Let $h$ be a complete history, and $H$ a history set.
  Then $h \in \overline{H}$ if{f} the propositional formula
  $$\db{\textsc{Stronger}(h) \land \textsc{Theory}(H)}$$
  is satisfiable.

\end{corollary}

\subsection{Incomplete Histories}
\label{sec:propositional:pending}

The pending operations of a history $h$ may be omitted in a stronger history or
they may be completed with arbitrary return values. Therefore, the set of
histories stronger than a history $h$ can be characterized by a formula
obtained from $\textsc{Stronger}(h)$ by adding a domain predicate ${\sf used}$
that is constrained to contain all the completed operations of $h$ and by
omitting the constraints on the return values of pending operations. Moreover,
every operation of $h$ whose return value is different from $\bot$ in a model
of this formula (this may be an operation which is pending in $h$) should
satisfy ${\sf used}$. It can be proved that every history stronger than $h$
corresponds to a model of this formula, projected on the set of operations
satisfying ${\sf used}$.

Thus, we override the $\textsc{Stronger}(h)$ formula for incomplete histories
$h$ as the conjunction
\begin{align*}
  \textsc{Domain}(h) \land \textsc{Labels}(h) \land \textsc{Order}(h) \land \textsc{Used},
\end{align*}
where $\textsc{Used}$ is defined in Figure~\ref{fig:formula:history}.

For arbitrary, not necessarily complete, histories $h$, the models of
$\textsc{Stronger}(h)$ are histories paired with an interpretation $U : O \to
\mathbb{B}$ for the domain predicate ${\sf used}$, mapping the operations $O$ of
$h$ to $\set{\sf true, false}$ . Given such a model $\tup{h,U}$, let $U(h)$ be
the history obtained from $h$ by deleting operations $o$ such that $\lnot U(o)$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:stronger_form_pending}

  Let $h$ and $h'$ be histories, and $U : O' \to \mathbb{B}$.
  Then $h', U \models \textsc{Stronger}(h)$ if{f} $h \preceq U(h')$.

\end{lemma}

We leverage the predicate {\sf used} to guard the domain of quantifiers in
$\textsc{Theory}(H)$. For simplicity, we assume that $\textsc{Theory}(H)$ is
given in prenex normal form, whose quantifier prefix is of the form $\forall^*
\exists^*$. All of the formulas of
Figures~\ref{fig:formulas:common}--\ref{fig:formulas:synchronization} can be
written in this form. We thus define the guarded formula $G(\varphi)$ of the formula
$\varphi = \forall \vec{x}. \exists \vec{y}. \psi$ as
\begin{align*}
  G(\varphi) = \forall \vec{x}. \exists \vec{y}.
  \bigwedge_{x_i} {\sf used}(x_i) \implies 
  \bigwedge_{y_i} {\sf used}(y_i) \land \psi
\end{align*}
As usual, universal quantifiers are guarded using implication and existential
quantifiers using conjunction. It follows from
Lemma~\ref{lem:stronger_form_pending} that history membership reduces to
first-order satisfiability.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{th:satisfiability_complete}

  Let $h$ be a history, and $H$ a history set. Then $h \in \overline{H}$ if{f}
  the first-order formula
  $$\textsc{Stronger}(h) \land G(\textsc{Theory}(H))$$
  is satisfiable.

\end{theorem}

We again reduce this first-order satisfiability problem to propositional
satisfiability by limiting the domain of quantifiers to the operations of $h$
via the function $\db{\cdot}$.

\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:satisfiability_pending}

  Let $h$ be a history, and $H$ a history set. Then $h \in \overline{H}$ if{f}
  the propositional formula
  $$\db{\textsc{Stronger}(h) \land G(\textsc{Theory}(H))}$$
  is satisfiable.

\end{corollary}
