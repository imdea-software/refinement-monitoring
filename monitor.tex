%\section{Monitoring History Inclusion}

\section{Reducing history membership to propositional SAT}\label{ssec:complete}

%A history formula describing the set of histories $H(B)$ 
%of a library basis $B$ is considered a specification for the entire library.
%
%Since every execution of a library $L$ can be obtained through the $~>$ rewriting 
%from an execution of a given basis $B$, 

%\begin{definition}
%
%A formula $\psi$ \emph{represents} $L$ iff there exists a basis $B$ of $L$ such that 
%for every history $h$, $h\in H(B)$ iff $h\models \psi$.
%
%\end{definition}

%Since $\psi$ is required to characterize only histories of a basis of $L$, there are
%histories of $L$ that don't satisfy $\psi$. However, for every history of $L$ there
%exists a stronger history which satisfies $\psi$.
Given a formula $\psi$ describing a basis of $L$, 
checking whether a history $h$ belongs to $H(L)$ 
can be reduced to propositional satisfiability. 
Thus, by Lemma~\ref{lemma:kernel_histories}, a history $h$ belongs to $H(L)$ iff 
it is weaker than a history $h'$ in a basis of $L$, or equivalently, weaker than a history
$h'$ satisfying $\psi$.
When $h$ is a complete history, the fact that any stronger history contains exactly the same set of 
operations~\footnote{More precisely, there exists a bijection between the set of operations in $h$ and respectively $h'$.}
enables the construction of a formula  $\mathit{Stronger}_c(h)$ characterizing all the histories
stronger than $h$. This formula conjuncted with $\psi$ describes all the histories stronger than $h$
that satisfy $\psi$. Therefore, the satisfiability of $\mathit{Stronger}_c(h)\land \psi$ is
equivalent to $h\in H(L)$. 
When the history $h$ contains pending operations, a stronger history $h'$ may contain
less operations (pending operations of $h$ can be omitted in $h'$)
and some pending operations of $h$ may be completed in $h'$.  
Therefore, the formula $\mathit{Stronger}_c(h)$ is enhanced with a domain predicate $\<ops>$
defining the set of operations in the stronger history and the return values of the pending
operations are left unconstrained. The conjunction between the obtained
formula and the formula $\psi'$ obtained from $\psi$ by guarding the quantified variables to satisfy
the domain predicate $\<ops>$ characterizes the histories stronger
than $h$ which satisfy $\psi$.

%$h\in H(L)$ is equivalent to the fact that $\mathit{Hist}(h)$ is consistent
%with the formula $\psi$ where the quantifiers are guarded by a domain predicate representing the
%set of operations in a history stronger than $h$.
%using the same
%function and predicate symbols as $\psi$. 
%using different versions $\<hb>_h$, $\<match>_h$, $\ldots$ of the predicates $\<hb>$, $\<match>$, $\ldots$, 
%and $\mathit{Weaker}$ is a formula expressing the fact that $\<hb>_h$ is included in $\<hb>$, 
%$\<match>_h$ is exactly $\<match>$, etc.

\subsection{Complete Histories}

The following two lemmas characterize the weaker than relation between histories. 
The first one states that the matching function of a history, projected over completed operations, 
is preserved by any stronger history. The second lemma states that a history $h'$ stronger than
a complete history $h$ can only differ in having more order constraints between the operations,
the operation labels and the matching function being the same in $h$ and $h'$.

\begin{lemma}

Let $h_1=\tup{O_1,<_1,f_1}$ and $h_2=\tup{O_2,<_2,f_2}$ be two histories. If $h_1\preceq_g h_2$ then
for every two completed operations $o_1, o_2\in O_1$, 
\[
\<Matching>(h_1)(o_1)=o_2\text{ iff }\<Matching>(h_2)(g^{-1}(o_1))=g^{-1}(o_2).
\]

\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:complete_history}

A complete history $h_1=\tup{O_1,<_1,f_1}$ is weaker than another history $h_2=\tup{O_2,<_2,f_2}$ 
iff there exists a bijection $g:O_2->O_1$ such that: %for every two operations $o, o'\in O_1$, 
\begin{itemize}

	\item operations related by $g$ have the same label, i.e., for each $o\in O_1$, $f_1(o)=f_2(g^{-1}(o))$,

	\item order constraints are preserved from $h_1$ to $h_2$, i.e., for each $o,o'\in O_1$, $o<_1 o'$ implies $g^{-1}(o)<_2 g^{-1}(o')$, and

	\item the matching function is the same for the two histories, i.e., for each $o,o'\in O_1$, $\<Matching>(h_1)(o)=o'$ iff $\<Matching>(h_2)(g^{-1}(o))=g^{-1}(o')$.

\end{itemize}

\end{lemma}

Given a complete history $h=\tup{O,<,f}$, let $\mathit{Stronger}_c(h)$ be a formula that characterizes
the labels, the matching function, and the order of $h$ (the operation identifiers in $O$ are used as constants):
\begin{align*}
\mathit{Stronger}_c(h)\ \triangleq\ & \forall x.\ x\in O\ \ \land \<Distinct>(O) \\
		    & \hspace{-13mm}\land\ \hspace{-2.5mm}\bigwedge_{o,o'\in O, o<o'} \hspace{-2.3mm}\<b>(o,o')\land \bigwedge_{\<Matching>(h)(o,o')} \<match>(o,o') \\
		    & \hspace{-13mm}\land\ \hspace{-7mm}\bigwedge_{\scriptsize \begin{array}{c} f(o)=m(u)=>v\end{array}} \hspace{-8mm} \<meth>(o)=m\land \<arg>(o)=u\land \<ret>(o)=v 
%		   \hspace{-7mm}\bigwedge_{\scriptsize \begin{array}{c} o,o'\in O\\f(o)=m(u)=>v\\f(o)=m'(v)=>v'\end{array}} \hspace{-7mm} \<Val>(o,o') \\
		   %\land \<PO>(<)
\end{align*}
The first sub-formula restricts the interpretation domain of every 
operation-identifier variable to $O$. The formula $x\in O$ is a syntactic sugar for 
$
\bigvee_{o\in O} x=o
$. 
The sub-formula $\<Distinct>(O)$ states that every two operation identifier constants are distinct,
i.e.,
$
\<Distinct>(O)\triangleq \bigwedge_{o_1,o_2\in O} o_1\neq o_2
$. 

%It uses indexed versions of the predicate and function symbols introduced in Section~\ref{sec:logic}
%The last sub-formula uses a relation symbol $\<hb>(o,o')$

%Also, let $\mathit{Weaker}$ be a formula expressing the weaker than relation between $h$ and another history 
%described using the standard symbols $\<hb>$, $\<meth>$, $\ldots$
%\begin{align*}
%\mathit{Weaker}\ \triangleq\ &\bigwedge_{F\in\{\<meth>,\<arg>,\<ret>\}} \forall x.\ F_h(x)=F(x) \\
%& \land\ \forall x,x'.\ \<hb>_h(x,x') => \<hb>(x,x')\\
%& \land\  \forall x,x'.\ \<match>_h(x,x') <=> \<match>(x,x')
%\end{align*}

%Also, let $\<Dom>(O)::=\forall x. x\in O$ be a


%Also, given $h$, let $F[h]$ be the HL formula $F$ where the relation symbol $<_k$ is replaced by $<$
%and the quantifiers are instantiated on the set of operations $O$, 
%i.e., every sub-formula $\exists x.\ G$ of $F$ is rewritten into
%\[
%\bigvee_{o\in O} G[x\mapsto o].
%\]

The following result states that $\mathit{Stronger}_c(h)$ characterizes precisely
all the histories stronger than $h$. It is a direct consequence of Lemma~\ref{lemma:complete_history}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:stronger_form_complete}

Let $h$ be a complete history. Then, for every history $h'$,
\begin{align*}
h\preceq h'\text{ iff }h'\models \mathit{Stronger}_c(h).
\end{align*}

\end{lemma}

Lemmas~\ref{lemma:kernel_histories} and~\ref{lem:stronger_form_complete} enable the following 
reduction from history membership to first-order satisfiability.

\begin{theorem}\label{th:satisfiability_pending}
Let $h$ be a complete history and $\psi$ a formula describing a basis of $L$.
Then,
\[
h\in H(L)\mbox{ iff }\mathit{Stronger}_c(h)\land \psi\mbox{ is satisfiable.}
\]
\end{theorem}
%\begin{proof}
%($=>$) This direction is a direct consequence of Lemmas~\ref{lemma:kernel_histories} and~\ref{lemma:complete_history}.
%
%%Let $h=\tup{O,<,f}$. Since $h\models \psi$, there exists a relation $\poker\subseteq O\times O$
%%such that $\tup{h,\poker}\models\psi'$, which implies that $\tup{h,\poker}$ is a model of $\varphi(h)\land \psi'$.
%
%($\Leftarrow$) The interpretation of $\<match>_h$, $\<hb>_h$, and $F_h$ with $F\in \{\<meth>,\<arg>,\<ret>\}$ 
%from a model of $\mathit{Hist}(h)\land\mathit{Weaker}\land \psi$ defines a history $h'$ such that $h\preceq h'$.
%On the other hand, the interpretation of $\<match>$, $\<hb>$, $\<meth>$, $\<arg>$, $\<ret>$ defines a history
%$h''$ such that $h'\preceq h''$ and $h''\models \psi$. Therefore, $h\preceq h''$ and $h''\models \psi$, which 
%by Lemma~\ref{lemma:kernel_histories} imply that $h\in H(L)$.
%\end{proof}

%\textcolor{red}{Say that there are no function symbols on input and output values, only = and $\leq$}

Assuming that the formula $\psi$ doesn't contain function symbols on input and output values but only
a fixed set of predicates, e.g., $=$ and $\leq$, which is the case for all the formulas in Figure~\ref{fig:examples_formulas}, 
the satisfiability of $\mathit{Stronger}_c(h)\land \psi$ 
can be reduced to propositional satisfiability.
This is based on the fact that $\mathit{Stronger}_c(h)$ fixes the domain of the operation-identifier variables to $O$
and every quantifier can be replaced by a finite conjunction/disjunction, e.g., every sub-formula $\exists x.\ A$ is replaced by 
$
\bigvee_{o\in O}\ A[x\mapsto o]
$.
Before eliminating the quantifiers, one also needs to add some universally-quantified axioms to 
express the fact that $\<b>$ is interpreted as a partial order and that $\<match>$ is interpreted as a 
partial function.
%existential quantifiers can be replaced by finite 
%disjunctions, i.e., every sub-formula $\exists x.\ A$ is replaced by 
%$
%\bigvee_{o\in O}\ A[x\mapsto o]
%$.
%The formula obtained by removing the existential quantifiers belongs to the EPR fragment
%(also known as the Bernays-Sch\"{o}nfinkel class),  whose satisfiability is known to be reducible to
%propositional satisfiability in polynomial time, provided that the quantifier count is fixed.
%The EPR fragment consists of first-order
%formulas with no occurrences of function symbols other than constants, and which  
%when written in the prenex normal form have the quantifier prefix $\exists^*\forall^*$.
%The formula $\varphi(h)\land \<Dom>(O)\land \psi'$ has no function symbols other than constants
%and by removing the existential quantifiers, it has a quantifier prefix $\forall^*$.
Therefore, one can construct a propositional formula $\mathit{Bool}_c(h,\psi)$, which
is equi-satisfiable to $\mathit{Stronger}_c(h)\land \psi$. The construction of
$\mathit{Bool}_c(h,\psi)$ can be done in polynomial time provided that the number of
quantifiers in $\psi$ is fixed, which is the case for all the formulas in Figure~\ref{fig:examples_formulas}.


\begin{corollary}\label{cor:satisfiability_complete}

Let $h$ be a complete history and $\psi$ a formula describing a basis of $L$. Then,
\[
h\in H(L)\mbox{ iff the formula}\ \mathit{Bool}_c(h,\psi)\mbox{ is satisfiable.}
\]

\end{corollary}

\subsection{Handling pending operations}\label{ssec:pending}

%The pending operations of a history $h$ may be omitted in a history stronger than $h$.
In the case of an arbitrary history $h$, the set of histories stronger than $h$ 
can be characterized by a formula obtained from $\mathit{Stronger}_c(h)$
by adding a domain predicate $\<ops>$
that is constrained to contain all the completed operations of $h$
and by omitting the constraints on the return values of pending operations.
Moreover, every operation of $h$ whose return value is different from $\bot$
in a model of this formula (this may be an operation which is pending in $h$) 
should satisfy $\<ops>$.
It can be proved that every history stronger than $h$ corresponds to a 
model of this formula, projected on the set of operations satisfying $\<ops>$.

Formally, let $\mathit{Stronger}(h)$ be the following formula:
\begin{align*}
\mathit{Stronger}(h)\ \triangleq\ & \forall x.\ x\in O\ \ \land \<Distinct>(O) \\
		    & \hspace{-10mm}\land\ \hspace{-2.5mm}\bigwedge_{o,o'\in O, o<o'} \hspace{-1.3mm}\<b>(o,o')\land \bigwedge_{\<Matching>(h)(o,o')} \<match>(o,o') \\
		    & \hspace{-10mm}\land\ \hspace{-7mm}\bigwedge_{\scriptsize \begin{array}{c} f(o)=m(u)=>v\end{array}} \hspace{-7mm} \<meth>(o)=m\land \<arg>(o)=u \\
		    & \hspace{-10mm}\land \ \hspace{-7mm}\bigwedge_{\scriptsize \begin{array}{c} f(o)=m(u)=>v\\ v\neq\bot\end{array}} \<ret>(o)=v\land \<ops>(o) \\
		    & \hspace{-10mm}\land \ \forall x.\ \<ret>(x)\neq\bot => \<ops>(x) %\bigwedge_{\scriptsize \begin{array}{c} f(o)=m(u)=>\bot\end{array}} \<ret>(o)\neq\bot => \<ops>(o)
\end{align*}

The models of $\mathit{Stronger}(h)$ are histories paired with an interpretation $D$ for the domain
predicate $\<ops>$. Given such a model $\tup{h',D}$, let $h'_D$ be the history obtained from $h'$
by removing all operations $o\not\in D$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:stronger_form_pending}

For every history $h$,
\begin{align*}
\tup{h',D}\models \mathit{Stronger}(h)\mbox{ iff }h\preceq h'_D
\end{align*}

\end{lemma}

The predicate $\<ops>$ is also used to guard the domain of the quantifiers in 
the formula $\psi$ defining a basis of the library $L$. For simplicity,
we assume that $\psi$ is given in prenex normal form and that it has a quantifier prefix 
of the form $\forall^*\exists^*$ (all the formulas in Figure~\ref{fig:examples_formulas} can 
be written in such a form). Thus, given $\psi=\forall \vec{x}\ \exists \vec{x}'.\ F$, 
let $\psi(\<ops>)$ be the formula:
\begin{align*}
\psi(\<ops>)\triangleq\forall \vec{x}\ \exists \vec{x}'.\ \bigwedge_{x\in\vec{x}}\ \<ops>(x) => \big(\bigwedge_{x'\in\vec{x}'}\ \<ops>(x') \land F\big)
\end{align*}
As usual, universal quantifiers are guarded using implication and existential quantifiers
using conjunction.



Lemmas~\ref{lemma:kernel_histories} and~\ref{lem:stronger_form_pending}
together with the guarded quantification added to $\psi$ imply that 
history membership can be reduced to first-order satisfiability.

\begin{theorem}\label{th:satisfiability_complete}
Let $h$ be a history and $\psi=\forall \vec{x}\ \exists \vec{x}'.\ F$ a formula describing a basis of $L$.
Then,
\[
h\in H(L)\mbox{ iff }\mathit{Stronger}(h)\land \psi(\<ops>)\mbox{ is satisfiable.}
\]
\end{theorem}


%The formula $\<PO>_c$ restricts the interpretation of the universally-quantified variables to
%complete operations:
%\<PO>_c(<)


The satisfiability of the formula $\mathit{Stronger}(h)\land \psi(\<ops>)$ can be again 
reduced to propositional satisfiability since the domain of the quantifiers is fixed to the set
of operations in $h$. Let $\mathit{Bool}(h,\psi)$ be the boolean formula equi-satisfiable
to $\mathit{Stronger}(h)\land \psi(\<ops>)$.

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:satisfiability_pending}

Let $h$ be a history and $\psi$ a formula describing a basis of $L$. Then,
\[
h\in H(L)\mbox{ iff the formula}\ \mathit{Bool}(h,\psi)\mbox{ is satisfiable.}
\]
\end{corollary}



\section{Removing Matched Operations}\label{ssec:removal}

%Since from a theoretical point of view, testing history membership is NP-complete~\cite{journals/siamcomp/GibbonsK97},

Checking history membership for large histories using the reduction to propositional SAT 
from Corollary~\ref{cor:satisfiability_pending} can still be quite inefficient. 
One way of dealing with this inefficiency is to check history membership for a fragment
of the given history provided that the smaller history being a violation to
history inclusion implies that the initial history is also a violation. 
However, deleting arbitrary operations from a history $h\in H(L)$
may result in a history $h'\not\in H(L)$. For example, removing the $\<write>(1)$ operation
from the history of the atomic register pictured in Figure~\ref{fig:removal_even_saturation}
results in a history which is not anymore admitted by this object. To identify the
removable operations that preserve history membership we rely on the matching function.

A \emph{match} of a history $h$ is an operation $o$ together with the maximal 
set of operations mapped by $\<Matching>(h)$ to $o$. Moreover, a match consists only of 
completed operations and at least one operation mapped to $o$. Formally, a match of a 
history $h=\tup{O,<,f}$ is a set of operations $m=o\cup \<Matching>^{-1}(h)(o)$ such 
that $o\in O$, $\<Matching>^{-1}(h)(o)\neq \emptyset$, and all the operations in $m$
are completed.

\begin{example}

Example of a match.

\end{example}

A set of histories $H$ is \emph{match-removal closed} iff for every history $h\in H$
and every match $m$ of $h$, $H$ contains the history obtained from $h$ by deleting the 
operations in $m$. The history obtained from another history $h$ by deleting a set
of operations $O$ is denoted by $h\setminus O$.

The bases of all the reference implementations described in Figure~\ref{fig:examples_formulas} are 
match-removal closed. For instance, consider a sequential history in the basis of an atomic queue
$\sigma_1\cdot \<add>(1)\cdot\sigma_2\cdot \<rem>=>1\cdot\sigma_3$ 
(the history is written as a sequence of operation labels) such that the matching function 
maps the $\<rem>=>1$ operation to the $\<add>(1)$ operation. 
These two operations form a match
because the matching function for queue histories is injective (there is only one
operation mapped to $\<add>(1)$).
The history $\sigma_1\cdot \sigma_2\cdot \sigma_3$ obtained by removing the match 
is also a valid sequential queue history: the order between the remaining adds and 
removes is not affected by this removal.

\fbox{Need a general explanation for this closure}

\begin{theorem}

The bases of the atomic stacks, queues, priority queues, sets, locks, semaphores, and of the
exchanger are match-removal closed.

\end{theorem}

The match-removal closure property extends from a basis to the entire library.
Therefore, if by deleting matches from a history we get a history which is not admitted
by a library $L$ then the initial history is also not admitted by $L$.

\begin{theorem}\label{th:match_closure}

If a basis of a library $L$ is match-removal closed, then $H(L)$ is also match-removal closed.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

Let $H(B)$ be a basis of $L$, $h$ a history in $H(L)$, and $m$
a match of $h$.
By Lemma~\ref{lemma:kernel_histories}, %and~\ref{lemma:pending_histories}, 
there exists a history $h'\in H(B)$ such that $h\preceq h'$. 
Since all the operations in $m$ are completed, they are included in $h'$ with the
same labeling. Moreover, the matching function projected over completed
operations is preserved from $h$ to $h'$. 
By hypothesis, $H(B)$ is match-removal closed which implies 
that the history $h_1'$ obtained from $h'$ by deleting the operations in $m$ 
is also in $H(B)$. From the definition of $\preceq$ it follows that
the history $h_1$ obtained from $h$ by deleting the operations in $m$ 
is weaker than $h_1'$ which implies $h_1\in H(L)$.
\end{proof}

While the statement of Theorem~\ref{th:match_closure} implies that a history
$h\setminus m$, where $m$ is a match of $h$, belongs to $H(L)$ whenever $h\in H(L)$,
Example~\ref{ex:complete_removal} shows that the reverse is not true. 
%Consequently, 
%a monitor that eagerly removes all matching clusters from the history it tracks 
%may miss some violations.

\begin{figure}

\input figures/complete_removal

\caption{A history that is not admitted by the atomic stack.}
\label{fig:complete_removal}

\end{figure}

\begin{example}\label{ex:complete_removal}

Figure~\ref{fig:complete_removal} pictures a history which is not admitted by the atomic stack:
since the element $3$ was pushed after $2$, $\<pop>=>3$ should not have started after 
$\<pop>=>2$ has finished.
%and $h'$, the latter being an
%extension of the former. 
The history obtained by removing the 
match $\{{\tt push}(2),{\tt pop}=>2\}$ is however admitted by the atomic stack.

\end{example}

When continuously checking membership to a reference implementation 
on a history that keeps extending with new operations, 
one must ensure that forgetting matches doesn't lead to spurious violations
at later times. In the continuation of Theorem~\ref{th:match_closure},
one should also prove that a match of  
a history $h$ is a match of every extension of $h$. In general, it can happen
is that a match of $h$ is strictly included in a match of an extension
and therefore, not a match of the extension.


Otherwise, removing a match before extending a history is equivalent to
removing a set of operations which is not a match from the extended history
(therefore, Theorem~\ref{th:match_closure} doesn't apply).
This result holds when the matching function of all histories in the library is injective
because every match has exactly two operations. All 
the reference implementations in Section~\ref{sec:logic} fall into this case 
except for the atomic sets and registers. 

A history $h_2$ \emph{extends} a history $h_1$, written $h_1 |> h_2$, iff $h_i$ is the history of an execution $e_i$, $i\in\{1,2\}$,
and $e_1$ is a prefix of $e_2$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:match_extension}

Let $L$ be a library s.t. $\<Matching>(h)$ is injective for all $h\in H(L)$.
For every two histories $h_1, h_2\in H(L)$ s.t. $h_1 |> h_2$,
if $m$ is a match of $h_1$ then $m$ is also a match of $h_2$.

\end{lemma}

When the matching function is not injective, 
a match $m$ of a history $h_1$ could be strictly included in a 
match of an extension $h_2$ which implies that $m$ is not a match of $h_2$. 

\begin{figure}

\input figures/removal_even_saturation

\caption{Two histories $h_1$ and $h_2$ of the atomic register, where $h_2$ is an extension of $h_1$.}
\label{fig:removal_even_saturation}

\end{figure}

\begin{example}\label{ex:removal_even_saturation}

Figure~\ref{fig:removal_even_saturation} pictures two histories $h_1$ and $h_2$ of the atomic
register, the latter being an extension of the former. 
The match $\{\<write>(1),\<read>=>1\}$ of $h_1$
is strictly included in the match $\{\<write>(1),\<read>=>1,\<read>=>1\}$ of $h_2$. 
Removing the match of $h_1$ and extending it with the $\<read>=>1$ operation
results in a spurious violation.

\end{example}

When the matching function is not injective



Lemma~\ref{lem:match_extension} and Theorem~\ref{th:match_closure} imply
that match removal is sound even 

\begin{corollary}

Let $L$ be a library with a match-removal closed basis
s.t. $\<Matching>(h)$ is injective for all $h\in H(L)$.
Then, for every two histories $h_1, h_2\in H(L)$ s.t. $h_1 |> h_2$ and
$m$ a match of $h_1$, 
$h_2\setminus m$ is a history of $L$.

\end{corollary}




Removing operations not in the matching relation, e.g. $\<pop>=>\<empty>$.

\newpage



Theorem~\ref{th:removing_matching} provides soundness guarantees for   
a monitor that instead of checking whether the tracked history belongs to $H(L)$,
checks whether a smaller history, obtained from $h$ by removing all matching clusters,
belongs to $H(L)$. In order to define a monitor that is allowed to remove
the matching clusters from the tracked history, either the matching relation $\<Matching>$
is injective or one needs to impose supplementary
conditions on the removed clusters. 
\begin{definition}

A matching cluster $O$ of a history $h$ is called \emph{obsolete} iff 

\begin{itemize}

	\item $\<Matching>$ is injective or

	\item there exists another matching cluster $O'$ of $h$ such that the positive operation in $O'$
	is obsolete and ordered after the positive operation in $O$

\end{itemize}

\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}

Let $L$ be a library such that for every two matching clusters $O_1$ and $O_2$ of a kernel history 
$h=\tup{O,<,f}$, $o_1<o_2$ for each $o_1\in O_1$ and $o_2\in O_2$. 
Also, let $h\in H(L)$ and $h'\in H(L)$ an extension of $h$. Then, there exists no matching cluster $O$ 
of $h'$, which strictly includes an obsolete matching cluster of $h$.

\end{lemma}




One way to avoid the incompleteness exhibited by Example~\ref{ex:complete_removal}
is to remove a matching cluster only if it consists of obsolete operations.
Example~\ref{ex:removal_no_saturation} shows that even this strategy is incomplete.
Intuitively, this happens because the monitor doesn't remember any constraints
on the kernel order implied by the presence of the matching cluster.

\begin{figure}

\input figures/removal_no_saturation

\caption{Removing the matching cluster $\{{\tt push}(1),{\tt pop}=>1\}$ formed of obsolete operations.}
\label{fig:removal_no_saturation}

\end{figure}

\begin{example}\label{ex:removal_no_saturation}

Figure~\ref{fig:removal_no_saturation} pictures two histories $h$ and $h'$, the latter being an
extension of the former. Even though the matching cluster $\{{\tt push}(1),{\tt pop}=>1\}$
consists only of obsolete operations, removing it from the history $h'\not\in H(L_{stacks})$ 
results in a history $h$ which is not anymore a violation, since $h\in H(L_{stacks})$.
In order to detect this violation, the monitor should remember the constraint
$\<push>(2) \poker \<pop>=>Empty$ implied by the presence of this matching cluster.

\end{example}
