\section{Concurrent objects}

We describe the class of concurrent objects considered in this paper. 

\subsection{Matching Relations}

We distinguish two sets of operation labels $\<PosLab> \subseteq \<Labels>$ and $\<NegLab> \subseteq \<Labels>$, called \emph{positive}, resp., \emph{negative}, operations labels.
We assume that each concurrent object defines a matching relation $\<Matching>\subseteq \<PosLab>\times \<NegLab>$ between positive and negative labels such that
$\<Matching>$ is functional and total in the second argument.


\begin{example}

Examples of relations $\<Matching>$ and how they can be implemented.

\end{example}

\subsection{Kernel Properties}

\begin{theorem}

The kernel $\ker L$ of a library $L$ is prefix-closed.

\end{theorem}

We assume concurrent libraries $L$ such that for any execution $e\in\ker L$ and $o_1$, $o_2$ two (complete) operations in $e$
with $\<Matching>(f(o_1),f(o_2))$, the execution $e\setminus\{o_1,o_2\}$ also belongs to $\ker L$.

\begin{example}

Show that all objects we know satisfy this property.

\end{example}
