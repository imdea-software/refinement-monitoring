\section{Bases Closure Properties}

TODO REMOVE THIS SECTION

In this work, we consider the problem of checking refinement with respect to libraries $L$ for which $\ker L$ is defined.
The histories of executions in $\ker L$ are $H(\ker L)=\set{H(e) : e\in \ker L}$.


Given a history $h=\tup{O,<,f}$, a set of operations $O'\subseteq O$ is called a \emph{matching cluster}
iff $O'$ consists of a single negative operation $o$ and all positive operations $o'$ with $\<Matching>(o,o')$.
A set of histories $H$ is closed under matching cluster removal iff $H$ contains all the histories
obtained by removing a matching cluster from another history in $H$. 
%We say that 
%a library $L$ is \emph{$\<Matching>$-closed} iff the set of kernel histories is closed under 
%matching cluster removal. 
Formally, given a history $h=\tup{O,<,f}$ and $O'\subseteq O$, 
\[
h\setminus O'=\tup{O\setminus O',<',f'},
\] 
where $<'=<|_{O\setminus O'}$, and $f'=f|_{O\setminus O'}$.

\begin{definition}

A set of histories $H$ is \emph{closed under matching cluster removal} 
(for short, $\<Matching>$-closed)
iff for every matching cluster $O'$ of a history $h\in H$,
the history $h\setminus O'$ also belongs to $H$.

\end{definition}

\begin{example}

Show that all objects we know satisfy this property.
